This project leverages AI-driven methodologies for the discovery of novel drug compounds. Initially, Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are employed to generate new molecular structures. VAEs facilitate the learning of the latent space of chemical structures, enabling the generation of diverse and chemically valid molecules. GANs, on the other hand, excel in creating realistic molecular structures by training a generator network to produce molecules and a discriminator network to di erentiate between real and generated molecules. In our project, GANs have demonstrated superior performance in generating novel drug compounds. 

The molecules generated by GANs are subsequently converted into Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) format and then transformed into Morgan Fingerprints, which are normalized for further analysis. These normalized fingerprints undergo toxicity testing (ADMET: Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity) using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Following this, the Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) is assessed to predict biological and physicochemical properties utilizing Random Forest Classifiers and Regressors.

Finally, the binding affinity and orientation of the drug molecules are evaluated through docking studies. Tools such as MGL Tools, Autodock, and Autodock Vina are employed to perform docking, providing nine possible orientations for each drug molecule. These docking results are visualized and simulated using PyMol, enabling the identification of the most promising drug-receptor interactions. This comprehensive AI-driven approach facilitates e cient exploration of chemical space, aiding in the discovery of novel drug candidates with desired pharmacological properties.
